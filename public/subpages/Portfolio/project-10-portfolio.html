          Hey guys, I made this portfolio website recently to showcase a handful of coding and software projects
          I have produced. Brainstorming and setup for this site started in late July 2023. I wanted to 
          benchmark my progression in the software space and show off some of my skills in a concise way. The 
          content is fairly similar to my older website spectre, however, I wanted to create a more discrete 
          theme and layout for this site if I am to share my work with others - the other website focused more 
          on game reviews. To make this website I relied more on Bootstrap styles to quickly incorporate cards,
          carousels, and the navbar. There are noticeably fewer custom styles and decorations than in my other 
          website but I decided that they were not necessary this time, and would increase complexity. I am
          pleased that I got a masonry layout working, and it was implemented with a simple script offered by
          Bootstrap (external JavaScript plugin). 

          The sitemap changed slightly and I may add or remove pages depending on the importance (such as 
          including a resume section). Another thing to note is that the website may not display correctly with 
          a loss of internet connection as the Bootstrap styles are delivered by a CDN and are not downloaded to
          assets - to improve loading speed.
